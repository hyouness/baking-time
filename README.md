# Baking Time Project

## Project Overview
In Project 4 of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program, **Baking Time** app was developed to allow Udacity's resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to 
share her recipes with the world.

This project tests:
- Using MediaPlayer/ExoPlayer to display videos.
- Handling error cases in Android.
- Adding a widget to app experience.
- Leveraging a third-party library.
- Using Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.


## Features

1) Look up recipes
2) Select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

## Room for Improvement
- Offline support for storing recipes
- Marking recipes as favorites with the ability to look them up
